                <p>I plan to enter the workforce as an embedded software engineer in 2025. 
                    Next, I will grow in technical depth with experience. Additionally, I plan to 
                    pursue a master's degree in Business Administration and grow into a team leadership role.

            <p>I had the priviledge to work with 3 amazing team mates on the Senior Design Project titled Video Pipeline for Machine Computer Vision!</p>
            <p>We created a video pipeline that takes in a video stream and outputs a video stream with pupils of people's eyes highlighted
                (per our client's requirements). It is deployed on an Ultra96v2 FPGA board and uses a MIPI camera sensor to capture the video stream. 
                The project was a great learning experience and allowed us to work with various technologies and tools.</p>
            <p>We learned and used Python, OpenCV, and Vitis AI to create the pipeline.</p>
            <p>I specifically worked with embedded systems on the FPGA. This included integrating the I/O and two algorithms on the FPGA dev board. </p>
            <p>In the big picture, our team contributed to the development of a subsystem that will help wheelchair-bound individuals
                have a better quality of life. </p>

                <h3>Project 1: CyBot Navigates Mars</h3>
                <p>I collaborated with a team of 3 other engineering students to program the above CyBot to navigate a "Mars-like" evnironment
                    remotely. We leveraged a Texas Instruments M4 series microcontroller to control the CyBot's motors and sensors.
                    Note that the CyBot had an ultrasonic sensor and an infared sensor attached atop of a servo motor to detect its surroundings
                    withour runnning into obstacles.
                    The CyBot was (almost) able to navigate the environment autonomously and avoid obstacles using a combination of sensors and algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>For this project, I contributed to all parts of it. Significant portions I did are: analog to digital conversion algorithms (ADCs),
                    navigation algorithms, and the motor control algorithms. I learned what embedded systems are and general programming skills.
                    I also grew my skillset to work with a team and communicate effectively.

                <h3>Project 2: Speaker Crossover</h3>
                <p>I designed the electrical circuitry to separate frequencies from an input to respective low (woofer), medium (mid-range), and high (tweeter) frequency
                    outputs. This was done using a combination of resistors, capacitors, and inductors. The project was part of an electrical engineering lab course, EE 230.
                    I exercised use of a breadboard, power supplies, and elecrtical filters create the circuit. I also learned how to use an oscilloscope to measure the output signals.
                    I fully designed and implemented this circuitry.

                <h3>Project 3: Develop ALU From VDHL</h3>
                <p>In CPRE 381, Computer Architecture, I designed, developed, and tested, and debugged the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for my team's processor.
                    This was developed in VDHL Hardware Design Language, tested using model sim, and deployed on an FPGA. I learned VDHL, 
                    Model Sim, and perserverence throught this project. The photo above is a function block representation of the ALU.
